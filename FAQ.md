A: Because **I don't want to**. I don't want to waste my time explaining things that are already covered in the **[GUIDE](https://github.com/AAndyProgram/SCrawler/wiki)**! If you didn't bother to read the guide, why would I waste my time?! ALL FUNCTIONALITY IS DESCRIBED IN THE GUIDE. Before publishing a new release, I update the guide. If you don't respect my work, I don't waste my time.

----

#### Q: **You lost me. Your program is too complicated.**

A: **I'm fine with that**. If the program is difficult for you or you can't configure it, I can only suggest you find another (easier) program. I really don't mind! The program is free. I am develop SCrawler for myself and publish on GitHub because people found my program useful. If someone can't use it or doesn't like it, I'm fine.

----

----

#### Q: **Can you add a step-by-step guide or video on how to use the program?**

A: **NO**! I will not do it. If you want, you can create a video tutorial and send it to me. Then I add it. All options and what each option does described on the wiki. The wiki also contains a description of all settings and how-to configure them. For complex settings, there is a steep-by-steep guide. Read the [main](README.md) information and [GUIDE](https://github.com/AAndyProgram/SCrawler/wiki/) and you won't have any problems. I have developed a program with an intuitive interface. There is a Settings button, download buttons, a context menu that drops down when a user is clicked, and other controls. Anyone can use it.
