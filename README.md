**Video on how to configure**

[![How to configure](https://img.youtube.com/vi/XDn7zG4I700/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDn7zG4I700)

# Installation

**Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/AAndyProgram/SCrawler/releases/latest), unzip the program archive to any folder and enjoy.** :blush:

**Don't put program in the `Program Files` system folder (this is portable program and program settings are stored in the program folder)**

**I highly doubt you can run SCrawler on Linux or Mac. SCrawler is a program that is heavily dependent on Windows.**

# Updating

Just download [latest](https://github.com/AAndyProgram/SCrawler/releases/latest) version and unpack it into the program folder. **Before launching a new version, I recommend making a backup copy of the program settings folder and user settings/data files.**

**You can also use the updater included in the release package.**
